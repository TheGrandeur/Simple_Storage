# Simple_Storage
Solidity Code for compile and deployed of smart contract on level 1 and level 2 crypto networks named Sapolia and zk-sync-Sapolia respectively.
üöÄ Project Overview: Deploying a Solidity Smart Contract on Sepolia and zkSync-Sepolia Networks üöÄ

I recently completed a project where I developed, compiled, and deployed a Solidity smart contract named Simple Storage. This project was an excellent opportunity to deepen my hands-on experience with blockchain development and explore both Level 1 and Level 2 blockchain networks.

üîß Project Details:
Smart Contract: The Simple Storage contract is a straightforward Solidity code that allows users to store and retrieve a single integer value on the blockchain. Despite its simplicity, this contract serves as a fundamental building block in understanding smart contract interactions.

Development Environment: I utilized the Remix IDE, a powerful online tool that provides an integrated environment for writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts. Remix IDE made it easy to compile the Solidity code and simulate interactions before actual deployment.

üåê Deployment:
Level 1 Deployment - Sepolia Network:

The Simple Storage contract was first deployed on the Sepolia testnet, a Level 1 Ethereum-compatible blockchain network. Sepolia is ideal for testing and development, providing a secure environment to ensure the contract's functionality before moving to more complex networks.

Faucet: To fund the deployment, I used a faucet from Google Cloud Web 3, which provided Sepolia ETH for testing purposes.

Level 2 Deployment - zkSync-Sepolia Network:

To explore scalability solutions, I deployed the same Simple Storage contract on the zkSync-Sepolia network, a Layer 2 scaling solution that leverages zero-knowledge proofs to enable faster and cheaper transactions while maintaining the security of Ethereum.

Faucet: Similar to the Sepolia deployment, I used faucets from Google Cloud Web 3 and other platforms to obtain the necessary tokens for deploying on zkSync-Sepolia.

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Insights:
Remix IDE provided a smooth experience for writing and compiling the contract. The IDE‚Äôs built-in tools for deployment and interaction made it easy to test the contract's behavior across different networks.
Deploying on both Level 1 (Sepolia) and Level 2 (zkSync-Sepolia) networks showcased the versatility of Solidity smart contracts and highlighted the benefits of Layer 2 solutions, particularly in terms of cost efficiency and transaction speed.
üéØ Learning Outcomes:
This project reinforced my understanding of Solidity, smart contract development, and the deployment process across different blockchain layers. It also provided valuable insights into the practical applications of Layer 2 solutions, which are becoming increasingly important as the demand for scalable blockchain applications grows.
